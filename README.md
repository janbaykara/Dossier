### Things. With context.
    
  A simple webapp & learning project, because I'm sick of google docs and postit notes. I'm using this as a sandbox to figure out things like unit testing, NodeJS application scaffolding, general JS tomfoolery and UI design experiments.
    
### Summary
  - Jot down & custom categorise things to remember
  - Automatically grab contextual API data for things
  - Get links to buy/download/view things
